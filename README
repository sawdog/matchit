* vim matchit for plug-vim

Since plug-vim no longer supports plugins from vim-scripts, the solution is
to make a fork in github. Originally sourced from
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39

This script provides the ability to configure % to match more than just
single characters.  It can match words or regular expressions.
Also, matching treats strings and comments (as recognized by the
syntax highlighting mechanism) intelligently.
