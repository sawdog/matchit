# Matchit

## Description

A vim plug originally from vim-scripts. Since vim-plug no longer 
supports plugins from vim-scripts, the solution is to make a fork in github. 
Originally sourced from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39

This script provides the ability to configure % to match more than just
single characters.  It can match words or regular expressions.
Also, matching treats strings and comments (as recognized by the
syntax highlighting mechanism) intelligently.

## Installation

Place in your vim-plug plugins file:
```Plug 'sawdog/matchit'```
